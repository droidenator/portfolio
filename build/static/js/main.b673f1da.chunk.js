After much brainstorming, it was decided to build an interactive exploded-view floorplan.\n\n    Users can click through each floor and view the details for specific apartments. Entering the data for the apartments was done with a custom Drupal component that allowed an admin to use a GUI interface to trace each apartment and enter the details.\n\n    The LEVEL website was built using Drupal 7. The admin tool for adding apartments is a custom Drupal module written in PHP and JavaScript. The floor plan explorer is built using jQuery, Raphael, and custom JavaScript.\n\n    This website won the 2012 "Best of Interactive" Addy award in Oklahoma.',video:[{url:"https://vimeo.com/369484760",image:"images/level.png"}],technologies:"JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP",urls:[{url:"https://levelokc.com/the-space/level",text:"LEVEL"}]},{name:"Sundance Airport Automated Weather Observation Service (AWOS)",description:"Sundance Airport needed a new application to display AWOS information and replace the legacy flash version provided by the AWOS vendor.\n\n    Two versions were designed and built.
